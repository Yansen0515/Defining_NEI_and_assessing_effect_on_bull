# Defining a nitrogen efficiency index in Holstein cows and assessing its potential effect on the breeding program of bulls

## This file inclued 4 supplemental results (1 Table and 3 Figures)

### The order  as follows:

- **Table 1S** Reliability for bulls (n = 736) for the N intake in primiparous (NINT1), milk true protein N in primiparous (MTPN1), milk urea nitrogen yield in primiparous (MUNY1), N intake in multiparous (NINT2+), milk true protein N in multiparous (MTPN2+), and milk urea nitrogen yield in multiparous (MUNY2+).

- **Figure 1S** Approximate genetic correlation between nitrogen intake (NINT) and other traits based on the EBV of selected bulls (n = 736) in primiparous (A, NINT1) and multiparous (B, NINT2+). 

- **Figure 2S** Approximate genetic correlation between milk true protein nitrogen (MTPN) and other traits based on the EBV of selected bulls (n = 736) in primiparous (A, MTPN1) and multiparous (B, MTPN2+). 

- **Figure 3S** Approximate genetic correlation between milk urea nitrogen yield (MUNY) and other traits based on the EBV of selected bulls (n = 736) in primiparous (A, MUNY1) and multiparous (B, MUNY2+).
